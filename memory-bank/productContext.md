# Product Context: Sala de Interrogatório

## Why This Project Exists
This game addresses the need for an engaging, narrative-driven investigative experience that combines logic, storytelling, and AI interaction. It solves the problem of static mystery games by introducing dynamic conversations while maintaining a controlled, fixed storyline to ensure fairness and consistency.

## Problems It Solves
- Lack of interactive interrogation in traditional mystery games.
- Difficulty in creating replayable, logical puzzles without procedural generation risks.
- Need for a cooperative detective experience that can scale from single to multiplayer.
- Provides an accessible entry point for beginners in investigative gaming.

## How It Works
Players select a scenario, review initial evidence and testimonies, interrogate suspects via AI chats, confront them with evidence to reveal secrets, and finally make an accusation. The system evaluates based on predefined truths, providing feedback on accuracy.

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive interface for chatting and managing evidence.
- Immersive narrative with logical progression.
- Satisfaction from uncovering truths through clever questioning.
- Clear feedback on progress and final verdict to encourage learning and replay.
